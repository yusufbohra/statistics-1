    "2. Ordinal Data:\n",
    "- Ordinal data is the second level of measurement and shares some similarities with nominal data, as it also involves categories or labels.\n",
    "- However, in ordinal data, the categories have a specific order or ranking, indicating relative differences between them. The rank order is meaningful, but the magnitude of differences between categories is not precisely measured.\n",
    "- Ordinal data allows you to identify whether one category is greater or lesser than another, but it does not provide information about the magnitude of the differences between the categories.\n",
    "- Mathematical operations like addition and subtraction are not applicable to ordinal data, but you can use median and mode as measures of central tendency.\n",
    "- Examples of ordinal data include survey responses (e.g., strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree), education levels (e.g., high school diploma, bachelor's degree, master's degree), or customer satisfaction ratings (e.g., very satisfied, satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied, very dissatisfied).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the key difference between nominal and ordinal data lies in the nature of the relationships between categories. Nominal data has no order or ranking, and categories are simply distinct labels. On the other hand, ordinal data has an order or ranking, but the specific differences between categories are not precisely quantifiable. Understanding the distinction between nominal and ordinal data is crucial when choosing appropriate statistical methods and interpreting the results accurately.\"\"\""
